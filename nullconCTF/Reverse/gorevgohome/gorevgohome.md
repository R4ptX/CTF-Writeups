Hint : docker run -it -v .:/app alpine:latest /bin/sh

## Solution

Downloading the binary, the first thing I’ve done is run `strings` on it. With that, we can instantly see it’s a Go binary based on all the runtime strings popping in the terminal.

After that, I tried to run the binary but was met with an error that a file wasn’t found. Then, I opened Ghidra and was met with tons of functions that I didn’t understand. Since the binary wasn’t possible to debug, I decided to go see Rusty Flag and came back when the Docker hint came out.

`docker run -it -v .:/app alpine:latest /bin/sh`

We understand from the hint that the binary needs to be run in an Alpine Docker container, so I’ve pulled the Alpine image and ran it with privileges

```shell
docker pull alpine
docker run --privileged -it -v .:/app alpine:latest /bin/sh
```

Now, being in the container, I first tried to run the binary and saw that it ran. We can now start debugging the binary properly, so I’ve started by adding tools to the Docker container:

```shell
apk add strace
apk add ltrace
apk add gdb
```

(Spoiler: gdb wasn’t useful in the end.)

I started with `strace` and saw that the binary was preventing `strace` from continuing by opening `/proc/self/status` in the file system. (That’s weird; I’ve never seen this type of anti-debug before.) Basically, the binary is checking the file for the `TracerPid` field to see if it’s being traced by another program (thank you ChatGPT)

Now this is where the fun begins; the next thing I did was running `ltrace` on the binary and we are met with this output:

This output is normal because the binary is not dynamically linked, but my brain, being hurt and tired from Rusty Flag, decided to `cat` `/proc/<PID>/exe`. I was expecting to see the Go binary again but was met with a smaller binary.

In this small binary, we could see the strings of the checker being used:

```text
-> Give me the secret:
-> well done
```

Interesting, why would the binary be smaller? (After the CTF, I’ve learned that the Go binary was a loader for other binaries.) That would mean that `/proc/<PID>/exe` is the final binary being loaded by the Go binary.

After that, I’ve transferred the binary to a file and transferred it out of the Docker container to pass it to Ghidra. Once I’m in Ghidra, I instantly started searching for the checker string and went to the specified function.

Once inside the function there’s only one thing catching my eye, and it’s those variables being XORed against four hex values:

Looking at the assembly, we can see three globals being in use:

```text
DAT_00403060
DAT_00403040
DAT_00403070
```

Looking at those variables, we can see that those are hex blobs. Here’s `DAT_00403040` as an example:

![[images/Pasted image 20250910202715.png]]

Based on all those values, I know that must be where the flag is hidden. With a snippet of the checker assembly code, the XOR keys, and the three hex blobs, we can build a script to decode the flag (thank you ChatGPT):

```python
import binascii

K0 = bytes.fromhex("ed 3f ac 6f 02 74 fe 2a 79 89 df a4 4a 07 dc 2d".replace(" ",""))
K1 = bytes.fromhex("fb 73 3b dd 46 9d e8 e4 74 b2 61 6c 6f f1 47 03".replace(" ",""))
T  = bytes.fromhex("a8 71 e3 14 50 47 a8 75 48 fa 80 e5 26 70 e8 54 88 2c 6b e9 77 f3 b7 a5 1a d6 3e 2a 1a bf 66 7e".replace(" ",""))

secret = bytes(a ^ b for a,b in zip(T, K0+K1))

print("Secret (hex):", secret.hex())
try:
    print("Secret (ascii):", secret.decode('utf-8'))
except Exception as e:
    print("Secret (ascii, repr):", repr(secret))
```

Flag: `ENO{R3V_1s_Alw4ys_P41n_And_FuN!}`
